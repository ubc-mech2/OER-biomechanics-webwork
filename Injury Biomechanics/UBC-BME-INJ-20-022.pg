BEGIN_TEXT
In a simplified, 2D frontal collision, a red car ($m1 kg) travelling $v1_kmh km/hr crashed into the rear end of a parked blue car ($m2 kg, $v2_kmh km/hr). Crush measurements taken from the red vehicle following the collision were as follows: $PAR C1 = $C1 cm, C2 = $C2 cm, C3 = $C3 cm, and C4 = $C4 cm. $PAR You may assume that A = $A \(N/cm\), B = $B \(N/cm^2\), and the width of the red car is $width1_mm mm. Assume the crush spans the width of the red vehicle.
